Ć Programming Language
======================

Ć is a new language, aimed at crafting 'portable programming libraries', with syntax akin to C#.
The translated code is lightweight (no virtual machine, emulation nor large runtime), human-readable
and fits well the target language (including naming conventions and documentation comments).

`cito` automatically translates the link:ci.html[Ć programming language]
to C, Java, C#, JavaScript, ActionScript, Perl, Object Pascal, PHP and http://dlang.org/[D].

See the *docs* directory for more information about the language and available tools.

Ć is released under the GPL 3 licence (see COPYING for more information).
